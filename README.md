Welcome to the NTUA ECE SAAS 2025 Project! This repository showcases a modern, service-oriented application developed as part of the Software Services Technologies course at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a cloud-ready, microservices-based architecture. It features multiple independent services, a user-friendly frontend, and robust backend components, all orchestrated to deliver a scalable and maintainable software solution.

## Features
- Modular microservices for user management, authentication, grading, reviews, and more
- Next.js frontend for a seamless user experience
- Database synchronization and data transformation utilities
- Well-documented architecture and deployment scripts
- Designed for extensibility and real-world deployment scenarios

## Team
